= Introduction =

*NIH* is a simple library for performing _all kinds of basic stuff_ that
the author wouldn't want *Not* to be *Invented Here*.

Parts of it are somewhat graphics oriented, containing fast algorithms
for point cloud manipulation and stuff like that.

As a library, it's supposed to be highly modular: one can simply include
a subset of its modules in its own project and everything should work
just as well (as long as dependencies are respected).
