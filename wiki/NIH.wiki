#summary NIH introductory page.

= Introduction =

*nih* is a simple library for performing _all kinds of basic stuff_ that
the author wouldn't want *not* to be *invented here* - and that will
necessarily be such for anybody else but him. ;)
Truth is, it just sounded good as a namespace.

Parts of it are somewhat graphics oriented, containing fast algorithms
for point cloud manipulation, hierarchy building and stuff like that.

As a library, it's supposed to be highly modular: one can simply include
a subset of its modules in its own project and everything should work
just as well (as long as dependencies are respected).
